# Simple .NET Core API

This is a .NET Core solution of two projects: API and a console API client.
API uses Entity Framework and a SQLite DB.

As usual execute these commands after opening solution in VS:

dotnet restore - to activate all needed dependencies

dotnet ef database update - to create the SQLite database
